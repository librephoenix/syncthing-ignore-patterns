#+title: Sane Syncthing Ignore Patterns

[[https://syncthing.net/][Syncthing]] is a FOSS P2P (peer-to-peer) file synchronization utility. When syncing files, there are, of course, files that shouldn't be synced. These are a collection of useful syncthing ignore patterns I use by default in my workflow. This is forked from [[https://github.com/M-Mono/Syncthing-Ignore-Patterns][M-Mono's Syncthing Ignore Patterns]].

Here is [[https://docs.syncthing.net/users/ignoring.html][documentation on ignore patterns in Syncthing]].
